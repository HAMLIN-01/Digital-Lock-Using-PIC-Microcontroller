# Digital-Lock-Using-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates a simple digital lock system using a PIC microcontroller. A password is entered through a 4x4 keypad, and if the correct password is entered, the system unlocks. The status is displayed on an LCD. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus.
